- 🎯 **Models**: Deploy and serve ML models

## 📚 What You Can Learn

### 1. **Visual Pipeline Development**
- 🎨 Create pipelines using the UI
- 📊 See real-time execution graphs
- 🔍 Debug failed components visually
- 📁 Inspect artifacts and outputs

### 2. **Complete ML Workflows**
- 🔄 Data ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment
- 📈 Hyperparameter tuning with Katib
- 🚀 Model serving with KServe
- 📊 Experiment comparison and analysis

### 3. **Production Patterns**

- 📦 Resource management
- 🌐 Service mesh architecture

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Week 1: Basics
1. 🚀 **Get familiar with the UI**
2. 📝 **Create your first notebook**
3. 🔄 **Run the hello-world pipeline**
4. 📊 **Explore the pipeline visualization**

### Week 2: Intermediate
1. 🔬 **Create experiments and organize runs**
2. 🎨 **Build custom pipeline components**
3. 📁 **Work with artifacts and datasets**
4. 📈 **Compare different runs and experiments**

### Week 3: Advanced

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Pods Are Still Starting
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n kubeflow
kubectl get pods -n istio-system

# Wait for specific components
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=ml-pipeline-ui -n kubeflow --timeout=600s
```

### If UI Won't Load
```bash
# Restart port forwarding
kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
```

### Performance Issues
- 🔄 Increase Minikube resources if needed
- 🧹 Clean up unused Docker images: `docker system prune`
- 💾 Monitor disk space: `df -h`

## 🎊 Success! 

You now have a **complete Kubeflow installation with full UI** that provides:

- ✅ **Real pipeline execution with visual monitoring**
- ✅ **All the learning value of production Kubeflow**
- ✅ **Web interface for intuitive interaction**
- ✅ **Native Apple Silicon support**

This gives you the **genuine Kubeflow experience** for learning all the concepts before moving to cloud or production environments!
